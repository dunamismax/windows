# PowerShell Script Template
# This script is designed to run silently with no output or logging.

# Your future script logic goes here.
# For example, the following is a placeholder for commands:

# Example: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
# Example: Write-Host "This is a placeholder for future commands."

# Suppress any output and prevent logging
$null = Out-Null

# Example of silent execution for a command (replace with actual logic)
# $result = Some-PowerShellCommand -SomeParameter
# $null = $result  # Discard the result to ensure no output is shown

# Reminder: Always use $null to suppress output of commands.
